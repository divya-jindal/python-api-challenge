# Python API Challenge
This repository contains two Python scripts, WeatherPy and VacationPy, designed for analyzing weather data and identifying ideal vacation spots based on specified weather conditions. Below is an overview of each script and instructions for running them.

## WeatherPy
### Project Overview
WeatherPy generates random geographic coordinates and compiles a list of cities based on these coordinates using the citipy library. It retrieves current weather data for each city from the OpenWeatherMap API, analyzes relationships between weather variables and latitude, and performs linear regression analysis to understand these relationships further.
### Requirements
- Python 3
- Required Python libraries: matplotlib, pandas, numpy, requests, scipy
- OpenWeatherMap API key (obtainable from OpenWeatherMap)

### Setup
Make sure to configure your API key from OpenWeatherMap and replace weather_api_key in api_keys.py with your key before running.

### Functionality
- Generates random geographic coordinates and compiles a list of cities.
- Retrieves weather data for each city from OpenWeatherMap.
- Visualizes relationships between weather variables and latitude using scatter plots.
- Performs linear regression analysis on weather data.

## VacationPy
### Project Overview
VacationPy analyzes weather data and identifies ideal vacation spots based on specified weather conditions. It uses geographic plotting to visualize weather data and integrates with the Geoapify API to find nearby hotels for each selected city meeting ideal weather criteria.

### Requirements
- Python 3
- Required Python libraries: hvplot, pandas, requests
- Geoapify API key (obtainable from Geoapify)

### Setup
Make sure to configure your API key from Geoapify and replace geoapify_key in api_keys.py with your key before running.

### Functionality
- Loads weather data from cities.csv generated by WeatherPy.
- Creates interactive maps plotting cities based on humidity and ideal weather conditions.
- Searches for nearby hotels using the Geoapify API and displays them on the map.
